## Background
### The United States Geological Survey, or USGS for short, is responsible for providing scientific data about natural hazards, the health of our ecosystems and environment, and the impacts of climate and land-use change. Their scientists develop new methods and tools to supply timely, relevant, and useful information about the Earth and its processes.

### The USGS is interested in building a new set of tools that will allow them to visualize their earthquake data. They collect a massive amount of data from all over the world each day, but they lack a meaningful way of displaying it. In this challenge, you have been tasked with developing a way to visualize USGS data that will allow them to better educate the public and other government organizations (and hopefully secure more funding) on issues facing our planet.

## Instructions
### In this project, I was responsible for developing an interactive dashboard utilizing the Leaflet library to visualize earthquake data provided by the United States Geological Survey (USGS). My primary objective was to create a map that accurately plots all earthquakes based on their longitude and latitude. The data markers were designed to represent the magnitude of each earthquake through size and to convey the depth of the earthquake through color coding. Additionally, I incorporated interactive popups that deliver detailed information about each earthquake when its corresponding marker is clicked. Furthermore, I implemented a legend to provide contextual information for the map data.
